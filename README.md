A Contact Management System in C is a simple, console-based application that helps users manage contact information efficiently. It allows for adding, viewing, searching, editing, and deleting contacts like names, phone numbers, and email addresses.

	•	Add Contacts: Users can input a contact’s name, phone number, and email.
	•	View Contacts: Displays all saved contacts in an organized format.
	•	Search Contacts: Enables quick searching by name or phone number.
	•	Edit Contacts: Allows users to update existing contact details.
	•	Delete Contacts: Contacts can be removed with confirmation to prevent errors.

The system often uses file handling to store data persistently, allowing contacts to be saved and accessed even after the program is closed. It’s a practical solution for managing personal or organizational contacts.
